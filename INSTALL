# DeltaMP installation informations

1. change/dive to installation directory

2. retrieve DeltaMP
	a. either by downloading the last release:
		wget https://github.com/lentendu/DeltaMP/archive/v0.2.tar.gz && tar xzvf DeltaMP-0.2.tar.gz
	
	b. alternatively, by cloning the development version:
		git clone https://github.com/lentendu/DeltaMP.git DeltaMP-0.2

3. cd to the newly created directory:
	cd DeltaMP-0.2 

4. edit the TAB-separated configuration file config.txt, by keeping the unmodified variable name on the first column and by modifying the second column with following values
    a. BATCH: name of the batch queuing system, either 'GridEngine' or 'Slurm'
    b. MODULES_TO_BE_LOADED: semi-column separated list of dependency modules to be loaded by the DeltaMP module
    c. MAX_CPU_PER_NODES: the number of CPUs on one node for MP parallel jobs

5. to build DeltaMP, a simple make is enough:
    make

If you want to modify the configuration informations from config.txt and re-build, first clean the previously built files and directories with:
    make clean

6. A modulefiles directory will be created inside the DeltaMP directory. To load the DeltaMP/0.2 module you have two options:
	a. either add the DeltaMP/modulefiles directory to your MODULEPATH variable by adding at the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/bash_profile file the following line :
		export MODULEPATH=/FULL/PATH/TO/DeltaMP/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
	with /FULL/PATH/TO/ being the full path to your DeltaMP directory
	
	b. or copy the DeltaMP/modulefiles/DeltaMP directory to your preferred modulefiles directory which is already in your MODULEPATH (or copy only the modulefile "0.2" if you already have a DeltaMP directory in your preferred modulefiles directory)

7. If you choose 6.a., you first need to reload your bash configurations to allow the detection of the newly set MODULEPATH variable:
	source ~/.bashrc
or
    source ~/.bash_profile

8. Finally, you can load the DeltaMP module with:
    module load DeltaMP/0.2
